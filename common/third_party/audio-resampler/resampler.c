// There are now two functions to initialize a resampler context. The legacy version is for
// arbitrary resampling operations with no fixed ratio (i.e., ASRCs), and its API is unchanged
// from previous versions of the resampler. The resampler initially targeted this use case.
//
// A new version of the initialization function, resamplerFixedRatioInit(), is for fixed-ratio
// sample rate conversions (i.e., conversions from one specific sample rate to another) with
// no fractional phase shift. This version can provide significantly improved performance and
// accuracy for such conversions. See the new function's description below.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Initialize a resampler context with the specified characteristics. The returned context pointer
// is used for all subsequent calls to the resampler (and should not be dereferenced). A NULL
// return indicates an error. For the flags parameter, note that SUBSAMPLE_INTERPOLATE and
// BLACKMAN_HARRIS are recommended for most applications. This function assumes that the "ratio"
// parameter will be appropriately specified for every call to the resampler. The parameters are:
//
// numChannels:     the number of audio channels present
//
// numTaps:         the number of taps for each sinc interpolation filter
//                    - must be a multiple of 4, from 4 - 1024 taps
//                    - affects quality by controlling cutoff sharpness of filters
//                    - linearly affects memory usage and CPU load of resampling
//
// numFilters:      the number of sinc filters generated
//                    - must be 1 - 1024
//                    - affects quality of interpolated filtering
//                    - linearly affects memory usage of resampler
//
// lowpassRatio:    enable lowpass by specifying the ratio relative to the Nyquist frequency of
//                   the *input* samples (must be > 0.0 and < 1.0); required for quality
//                   downsampling (except in special cases), but is optional otherwise
//                   ex: lowpassRatio = lowpass freq in Hz / (source rate in Hz / 2.0)
//
// flags:           mask for optional feature configuration:
//
//   SUBSAMPLE_INTERPOLATE:     interpolate values from adjacent filters
//                                - generally recommended except in special situations
//                                - approximately doubles the CPU load
//
//   BLACKMAN_HARRIS:           use 4-term Blackman Harris window function
//                                - generally recommended except in special situations
//                                - if not specified, the default window is Hann (raised cosine)
//                                  which has steeper cutoff but poorer stopband rejection
//
//   RESAMPLE_MULTITHREADED:    use multiple threads for processing multiple channels in parallel
//                                - might be slower depending on CPU, optimization, caching, etc.
//                                - optional (define ENABLE_THREADS)
//
//
//   EXTRAPOLATE_ENDPOINTS      enable sample extrapolation at the beginning and end of conversion
//                                - to use this properly, the resampleAdvance() function must be
//                                  called BEFORE sending any data to the resampler to delay the
//                                  initial conversion (otherwise samples will be generated
//                                  immediately when there aren't enough samples to extrapolate)
//                                - also, the new "flush" functionality must be used instead of
//                                  just sending zeros to the resampler to perform a final flush
//                                  (although this should be obvious)
//                                - optional (define ENABLE_EXTRAPOLATION)
//
//   EXTEND_CONVOLUTION_MATH    use precise math in convolution (doubles, not floats)
//                                - this can improve resampling quality, but just a few dB at best
//                                - can result in significant performance hit on some platforms
//                                - might be worth it, but generally not recommended
//                                - non-operational when the 64-bit path selected
// Notes:
//
// 1. The same resampling instance can be used for upsampling, downsampling, or simple (near-unity)
//    resampling (e.g., for asynchronous sample rate conversion, phase shifting, or filtering). The
//    behavior is controlled by the "ratio" parameter during the actual resample processing call.
//    To prevent aliasing, it's important to specify a lowpassRatio if the resampler will be used
//    for any significant degree of downsampling (ratio < 1.0), but the lowpass can also be used
//    independently without any rate conversion (or even when upsampling).
//
// 2. When the context is initialized (or reset) the sample histories are filled with silence such
//    that the resampler is ready to generate output immediately. However, this also means that there
//    is an implicit signal delay equal to half the tap length of the sinc filters in samples. If
//    zero delay is desired then that many samples can be ignored, or the resampleAdvancePosition()
//    function can be used to bypass them. Also, at the end of processing an equal length of silence
//    must be appended to the input audio to align the output with the actual input.
//
// 3. Both the number of interpolation filters and the number of taps per filter directly control
//    the fidelity of the resampling. The filter length has an approximately linear affect on the
//    the CPU load consumed by the resampler, and also on the memory requirement (both for the
//    filters themselves and also for the sample history storage). On the other hand, the number
//    of filters allocated primarily affects just the memory footprint (it has little affect on CPU
//    load and so can be large on systems with lots of RAM).
//
//  4. For a fixed-ratio conversion (i.e., conversions from one specific sample rate to another) with
//     no fractional phase shift, see resampleFixedRatioInit() below.

// (i.e., every calculation exactly aligns to a single filter). If this is possible then
// several advantages result. First, fewer filters are required which reduces the memory
// footprint. Also, the performance is approximately doubled due to the elimination of the

// also due to the lack of interpolation inaccuracies. Note that subsample phase shifts are
// not allowed in this mode, so if these are required set the NO_FILTER_REDUCTION bit in
// the flags to prevent this optimization.
//
// If the number of filters cannot be reduced because the sample rates are not sufficiently
